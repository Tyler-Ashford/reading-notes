# Text Editor!

I have some experience with the text editor VS Code, but I like how the author made it make sense of choosing one that you like that best making it personal to you, I love the3 dirrfent type of extensions you pick from that gives you the ability to customize your setup.

## The Command Line

The Command Line in itself is really a powerful tool being able to create files with mkdir, change directories  with the command cd are all helpful tools. I loved to learn more about file orginzation and how much easier if you have it setup to navigate and be organize files within the terminal.
