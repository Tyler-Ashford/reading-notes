# Html

This was one of my favorite topics as it laid out how to struture of a website.

The top I liked was learning the different tags and elements. These tags that stuck with me.

- <p></p>
- <em>
- <strong>
- <a>
- <img>

I learned how to link pages and how each attribute works in html.

- <main>
- <section>
- <footer>
- <nav>
